PCB 1V0: Daniel
known bugs
+ add 0R on ncs/mosi/sck coming from U101 to allow using U101 at the same time as U102 for syncin signal
+ as_* nets on FGPA2 are wrong on top page
+ conf_done and nStatus lines should be connected together
+ PD on LED enable lines
- silkscreen error R112/R131 switched

PCB 1v1: 05.04.2021 / Stefan Lechner
fixed: added R0402-0R on ncs/mosi/sck coming from U101
fixed: as_* nets on FGPA2 rewired
fixed: nconfig, conf_done and nStatus lines are connected together on FPGA1 and FPGA2, according to email from Daniel Foisy
fixed: added R0402-10k Pulldown on LED-Enable lines (pin 142 to 144 on FPGA)
fixed: reduced DRC errors to 2
changed: rework of silkscreen layer inkluding footprints in holo library
changed: adapted via size to have 150Âµm annular ring > std vias: 0.3/0.6mm and 0.4/0.7mm
changed: minor PCB routing cosmetics
new: added courtyards in holo library footprints
new: added fabrication symbols in holo library footprints
new: created pcb fabrication data (assembly plan)
new: added solder-mask strings for connector identification
new: added testpoints for system voltages
new: added pin1 mark on the transducers (round rectangle shaped pad)
